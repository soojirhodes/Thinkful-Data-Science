    "```\n",
    "𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 = 873 + 0.0012𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙_𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 + 0.00002𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙_𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒² − 223.57ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒_𝑘𝑖𝑑𝑠\n",

Interpret the estimated coefficients. What additional statistics can be given in order to ensure that your interpretations make sense statistically? Write up your answer.\n",

    "* First, load the dataset from the `weatherinszeged` table from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* Build a linear regression model where your target variable is the difference between the `apparenttemperature` and the `temperature`. As explanatory variables, use `humidity` and `windspeed`. Now, estimate your model using OLS. Are the estimated coefficients statistically significant? Are the signs of the estimated coefficients in line with your previous expectations? Interpret the estimated coefficients. What are the relations between the target and the explanatory variables?\n",
    "* Next, include the interaction of `humidity` and `windspeed` to the model above and estimate the model using OLS. Are the coefficients statistically significant? Did the signs of the estimated coefficients for `humidity` and `windspeed` change? Interpret the estimated coefficients.\n",

    "* Load the _houseprices_ data from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* Run your house prices model again and interpret the results. Which features are statistically significant, and which are not?\n",
    "* Now, exclude the insignificant features from your model. Did anything change?\n",
    "* Interpret the statistically significant coefficients by quantifying their relations with the house prices. Which features have a more prominent effect on house prices?\n",
