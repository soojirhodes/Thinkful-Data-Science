    "#### 1. Weather model\n",
    "For this assessment, you'll revisit the *historical temperature* dataset. To complete this assessment, submit a link to a Jupyter Notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, load the dataset from the weatherinszeged table from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* As in the previous lesson, build a linear regression model where your target variable is the difference between the `apparenttemperature` and the `temperature`. As explanatory variables, use `humidity` and `windspeed`. Now, estimate your model using OLS. What are the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values? Do you think they are satisfactory? Why?\n",
    "* Next, include the interaction of `humidity` and `windspeed` to the model above and estimate the model using OLS. Now, what is the R-squared of this model? Does this model improve upon the previous one?\n",
    "* Add `visibility` as an additional explanatory variable to the first model and estimate it. Did R-squared increase? What about adjusted R-squared? Compare the differences put on the table by the interaction term and the `visibility` in terms of the improvement in the adjusted R-squared. Which one is more useful?\n",
    "* Choose the best one from the three models above with respect to their AIC and BIC scores. Validate your choice by discussing your justification with your mentor.\n",
    "#### 2. House prices model\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work on your house prices model. To complete this assessment, submit a link to a Jupyter Notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the houseprices data from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* Run your *house prices* model again and assess the goodness of fit of your model using an F-test, R-squared, adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC.\n",
    "* Do you think that your model is satisfactory? If so, why?\n",
    "* In order to improve the goodness of fit of your model, try different model specifications by adding or removing some variables.\n",
    "* For each model that you try, get the goodness-of-fit metrics and compare your models with each other. Which model is the best and why?\n",
